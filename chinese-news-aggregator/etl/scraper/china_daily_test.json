It faithfully records the past journey and gives us inspiration for the future. President Nixon's pragmatic diplomacy culminated in this monumental visit 50 years ago, and his legacy still serves as an important reference today,\" Qin said.</p>", "<p>Over the last 43 years of diplomatic relations, the two countries have grown into \"a close-knit community with inseparable economic interests,\" and China-US relations have become just \"too big to fail\", the ambassador said.</p>", "<p>He emphasized that the two countries share many common interests, such as two-way trade, cross-border investment by companies, students studying abroad, as well as sister-cities relations. He pointed to global challenges such as climate change, energy security, food security and the pandemic as \"the common enemy\" that China and the US should tackle together.</p>", "<p>\"The new 'Cold War' should not be used to define the time we live in.
